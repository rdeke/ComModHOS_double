# Welcome to ComModHOS

## Course introduction

This Computational modelling unit is part of the Floating and Submerged structures module (CIEM4230). 

The module addresses the design, monitoring and assessment of floating and (semi)-submerged civil engineering solutions for infrastructural and urban development applications, for instance floating bridges and moored tunnels, including control, installation, maintenance and economics. This implies that the structure should be understood as a system as a whole and the varying environmental interactions – aerodynamic, hydrodynamic and soil – be considered in conjunction.
The content of the module contributes to the MUDE and Ethics learning lines.

This Jupyterbook specifically forms the outline of the Numerical Modelling unit of the module. It is created in order to give an overview of the numerical modelling aspect of this module. The unit gives student an overview of the required theory, structured per week. After the theory one or more example applications are added in the form of tutorial notebooks. Answers are generally provided, but it is encrouraged to try and find the solutions yourself. For this weekly tutorial sessions will be given, where discussion on the solution methods can take place. Other than the Python notebooks some comparisons are made using other programs and laguages suchs as [Maple](https://www.maplesoft.com/) and [Julia](https://julialang.org/). Installation of the additional software is not required, although recommended.

## Course objectives
1. MLO-1. 
   Create floating and submerged solutions solutions based on future natural and societal needs, using available scientific knowledge (HOS-1, 3).
2. MLO-2. 
   Evaluate floating and submerged structures in interaction with the surrounding environment, using available scientific knowledge (HOS-2, 3).
3. MLO-3. 
   Convey quantified uncertain outcomes corresponding the design of hydraulic and offshore structures (HOS-4).
4. MLO-4. 
   Propose new ways for dealing with ethical issues within the field of hydraulic and offshore structures from the perspective of different relevant moral frameworks (HOS-4).
5. MLO-5. 
   Conduct a solution-oriented debate with stakeholders about ethical issues within the field of hydraulic and offshore structures, while acknowledging real-world constraints in terms of technological possibilities, governance and institutional options (HOS-4).
