    "Before going into more details on how to find a numerical approximation, let's start by refreshing some theory about **[Taylor series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series)**. As one can find in the Wikipedia page:\n",
    "\n",
    "> *the **Taylor series** of a function is an infinite sum of terms that are expressed in terms of the function's derivatives at a single point.*\n",
    "\n",
    "That is $$ f(x)=\\sum_{i=0}^\\infty\\frac{f^{(i)}(a)}{i!}(x-a)^i. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The series is exact for an arbitrary function as long as we include infinite terms in the sum. However, here we are interested on an approximation that includes only the first $r$ terms of the expansion: $$ f_r(x)=\\sum_{i=0}^r\\frac{f^{(i)}(a)}{i!}(x-a)^i\\approx f(x). $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how this work in a practical example. We consider here the function $f(x)=\\sin(x)$ and we want to approximate this function knowing the function value and its derivatives at the point $a=0$. Using five terms in the expansion, $r=5$, we have that \n",
    "$$\\begin{align*}f_5(x) &= \\sin(0) + x\\cos(0) - \\frac{x^2}{2}\\sin(0) - \\frac{x^3}{6}\\cos(0) + \\frac{x^4}{24}\\sin(0) + \\frac{x^5}{120}\\cos(0)\\\\\n",

    "\\end{align*} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "We now can do a first coding exercise with this example and see how this approximation looks like for different values of $r$. To do so, we explicitly define the approximated functions.\n",
