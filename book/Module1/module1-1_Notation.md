# 1.1. Problem setting and notation

Let's assume that we want to find an analytical expression of a function that describes the displacement an object in time, denoted as $ u(t) $. For simplicity, we assume that this object only has one degree of freedom (DOF), *e.g.* the vertical displacement of the centre of gravity of a floating vessel. We also assume that the object satisfies the equation of motion given by a linear mass-damping-stiffness system:

$$ m\ddot{u}(t)+c\dot{u}(t)+ku(t)=F(t), $$

with $m$ the mass of the object, $c$ the damping and $k$ the stiffness. $ F(t) $ is a time-dependent forcing term. We also provide appropriate initial conditions, in that case 

$$ u(0)=0,\quad\dot{u}(0)=\dot{u}_0. $$

In General, and mostly depending on the complexity of the forcing term $ F(t) $, it is difficult to find an analytical expression that is defined at all times, $u(t)\, âˆ€ t\in[0,\infty)$, see red blue in the following figure.

Analytical vs approximated functions
```

Instead, we might be interested in knowing the value of the function at specific points in time, $u(t_0),u(t_1),u(t_2),...,u(t_N)$, see red dots in the previous figure. From these set of values, one can reconstruct an approximated function $\tilde{u}_N(t)$ by, for instance, using a linear interpolation between points (green line in the figure).

For smooth enough functions, $u(t)$, as we increase the number of evaluation points in time, $N$, the approximated solution solution $\tilde{u}_N(t)$ will be closer to $u(t)$.

In this course we will learn how to find approximate solutions like $\tilde{u}_N(t)$ by using numerical methods.

## Notation
In these notes we will use the following notation, see the figure below: 
* $u_i:=u(t_i)$, the function evaluated at time $t_i$. 
* $\Delta t_i:=t_i-t_{i-1}$, the time step between two consecutive time steps, $t_{i-1}$ and $t_i$.
When considering constant time steps, in an interval of time $t\in[0,T]$ with $N$ time steps, the time step size will be $\Delta t=T/N$.
