    "## Part 5.4 Other schemes and their benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "As you would excpect, or may even emember from earlier courses, there are a lot of other different options for these transient problems. We will quicly give an overview of the main options and their benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Forward Euler** <br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "    $$ w_{n+1} = w_n + \\Delta t f(t_n, w_n) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "    with the $f$ the slope of the tangent. This is the simplest method: single step and explicit. It has an order of convergence of 1. <br>\n",
    "    The explicit nature does impose a limit on the allowable timestep $\\Delta t$ to ensure stability. While the exact derivation is left for other courses, it is important to note that for the FE method the time step $\\Delta t \\leq \\frac{-2}{\\lambda}$ with $\\lambda = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}(\\hat t, \\hat y)$ with $f$ still being the slope of the tangent, and $(\\hat t, \\hat y)$ denoting the initial values of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Example**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    $$ \n",
    "    \\begin{cases} y'= -10y^2 + 20 & when \\hspace{5pt} t > 0 \\\\ y(0) = 0 \\end{cases}\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here we get $\\lambda = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}(\\hat t, \\hat y) = -20 \\hat y $ so that $\\Delta t \\leq \\frac{-2}{\\lambda}  = \\frac{1}{10\\hat y} = \\frac{1}{10 \\cdot \\sqrt{2}}$\n",
    "    As a final sidenote the stability discussed here is what we consider \"numerical stability\". It could also be possible that the equation itself is unstable and approaches infinity after a certain amount of finite time. As a general rule this can happen when $\\lambda \\geq 0$, but the concept is not explored further.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Backward Euler** <br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "    $$ w_{n+1} = w_n + \\Delta t f(t_{n+1}, w_{n+1}) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "    This is a single step explicit metod. If f fepends linearly on y the solution can easily be computed, but more often than nod iterations are needed. While this takes some computaitonal power, the BE method is unconditionally stable, meaning that the time step can be increased.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Trapezoidal method** <br>\n",
    "    \n",
    "    $$ w_{n+n} = w_n + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2}(f(t_n,w_n) + f(t_{n+1,w_n+1})) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "    Single step implicit. Given that this method used the Backward-Euler scheme, it is also unconditionally stable.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Modified euler method** <br>\n",
    "    This method adapts the trapezoidal method by predicting the implicit term using an initial FE \"predictor\": <br>\n",
    "    Step 1: predictor \n",
    "\n",
    "    $$ \\bar w_{n+1}  = w_n + \\Delta t f(t_n,w_n)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "    Step 2: corrector\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$ w_{n+1}  = w_n + \\frac{\\Delta t}{2} (f(t_n,w_n) + f(t_{n+1},\\bar w_{n+11}))$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "    So we get the benefits from the modified-euler scheme without the added work from the implicit term.\n",
    "    This method is only stable when $\\Delta t \\leq \\frac{-2}{\\lambda}$. However, it can be shown that this method has a larger order of convergence $O(\\Delta t^2)$, indicating that larger time steps can be used to compensate for the additional work.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Higher order methods** <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "    Many igher order methdods have been developed, the most known ones are RK4 and RK5.\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate the stability of the systems the concept of stability-regions is introduced. As said the stability depends on the value of $\\lambda$, real or complex, positive or negative, as well as on the numerical stability introduced by the size of the time step. This is visualized below by C. Vuik (2018).\n",
