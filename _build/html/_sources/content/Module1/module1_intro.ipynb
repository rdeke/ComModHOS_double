    "## Problem setting and notation\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume that we want to find an analytical expression of a function that describes the displacement an object in time, denoted as $ u(t) $. For simplicity, we assume that this object only has one degree of freedom (DOF), *e.g.* the vertical displacement of the centre of gravity of a floating vessel. We also assume that the object satisfies the equation of motion given by a linear mass-damping-stiffness system:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ m\\ddot{u}(t)+c\\dot{u}(t)+ku(t)=F(t), $$\n",
    "\n",
    "with $m$ the mass of the object, $c$ the damping and $k$ the stiffness. $ F(t) $ is a time-dependent forcing term. We also provide appropriate initial conditions, in that case \n",
    "$$ u(0)=0,\\quad\\dot{u}(0)=\\dot{u}_0. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In General, and mostly depending on the complexity of the forcing term $ F(t) $, it is difficult to find an analytical expression that is defined at all times, $u(t)\\, âˆ€ t\\in[0,\\infty)$, see red curve in the following figure.\n",

    "Analytical vs approximated functions\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we might be interested in knowing the value of the function at specific points in time, $u(t_0),u(t_1),u(t_2),...,u(t_N)$, see green dots in the previous figure. From these set of values, one can reconstruct an approximated function $\\tilde{u}_N(t)$ by, for instance, using a linear interpolation between points (blue dashed line in the figure).\n",
    "\n",
    "For smooth enough functions, $u(t)$, as we increase the number of evaluation points in time, $N$, the approximated solution solution $\\tilde{u}_N(t)$ will be closer to $u(t)$.\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{important}\n",
    "In this course we will learn how to find approximate solutions like $\\tilde{u}_N(t)$ by using numerical methods. \n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notation\n",
    "In these notes we will use the following notation: \n",
    "* $u_i:=u(t_i)$, the function evaluated at time $t_i$. \n",
    "* $\\Delta t_i:=t_i-t_{i-1}$, the time step between two consecutive time steps, $t_{i-1}$ and $t_i$.\n",
    "When considering constant time steps, in an interval of time $t\\in[0,T]$ with $N$ time steps, the time step size will be $\\Delta t=T/N$."
