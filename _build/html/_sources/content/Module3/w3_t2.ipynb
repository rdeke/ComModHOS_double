    "# Tutorial 3.2: Solving a cantilever beam with Finite Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will learn how to obtain the motion of a cantilever beam using Finite Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "The equation of motion of the beam is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\rho A \\ddot{w} + EI w'''' = q(x,t)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $w(t)$ is the deflection of the beam, $\\rho$ its density, $A$ its cross-sectional area, $E$ its Young's modulus, $I$ its second moment of area and $q(x,t)$ a distributed force applied to the beam. \n",
    "\n",
    "The boundary conditions for a cantilever beam are:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ w(0) = w'(0) = \\dot{w}(0) = \\ddot{w}(0) = 0 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$EI\\ w^{'''}(L) = F_{\\mathrm{ext}}(t) $$\n",
    "\n",

    "## The roadmap to finde the beam deflection  using Finite Differences\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps needed to discretize the beam are listed next. \n",
    "1. Discretize space into $N + 1$ points.\n",
    "2. Discretize the EOM of the beam. To do this, you will have to approximate the 4th order derivative with FD. Use a second order approximation. You can find the coefficients [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference_coefficient) (or google `finite difference coefficients' and click the Wikipedia page)}.\n",
    "3. Apply the boundary conditions. Use the definition of discrete derivatives and EOM to find the relation between the ghost points and the interior points.\n",
    "4. Combine all equations into matrices. \n",
    "5. Solve the resulting ODE system"
