    "# 1.2. Approximating ODEs with Taylor series\n",
    "\n",
    "We have seen that to approximate a function using Taylor series (TS), we just need the value of the function and its derivatives at a point. We now can use this tool to approximate the solution of ODEs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider the linear mass-damping-stiffness system defined before:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ m\\ddot{u}(t)+c\\dot{u}(t)+ku(t)=F(t), $$\n",
    "\n",
    "with appropriate initial conditions at $t=t_0$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ u(t_0)=u_0,\\quad\\dot{u}(t_0)=\\dot{u}_0. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we want to find the expression of a TS approximation of $u(t)$ around a point in time $t^*$. That is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ u(t)\\approx\\tilde{u}(t)=\\sum_{i=0}^r\\frac{u^{(i)}(t^*)}{i!}(x-t^*)^i. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Using $r=2$, this expression simplifies to\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\tilde{u}(t)=u(t^*) + \\dot{u}(t^*)(t-t^*) + \\frac{1}{2}\\ddot{u}(t^*)(t-t^*)^2. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The issue here is that in order to get the expression of $ \\tilde{u}(t) $, we first need the values $u(t^*)$, $\\dot{u}(t^*)$ and $\\ddot{u}(t^*)$ for a given $t^*$. If we select $t^*=t_0$, we can use the initial conditions, i.e. $u(t^*)=u(t_0)=u_0$ and $\\dot{u}(t^*)=\\dot{u}(t_0)=\\dot{u}_0$. Moreover, from the equation of motion, we can obtain the value for $\\ddot{u}(t^*)=\\ddot{u}(t_0)=\\frac{1}{m}(F(t_0)-ku_0-c\\dot{u}_0)$. Therefore, the appoximated solution $\\tilde{u}_1=\\tilde{u}(t_1)$ at time $t_1=t_0+Î” t$ will read \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\tilde{u}_1=u_0 + \\Delta t\\dot{u}_0 + \\frac{\\Delta t^2}{2}\\ddot{u}_0. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "As seen previously, the quality of the approximation depends on how far $t_1$ is from $t_0$, that is how large $\\Delta t$ is. This means that reducing $\\Delta t$ we will get a better approximation of $u$. Assuming that $\\tilde{u}_1$ is a good enough approximation of $u(t_1)$ and simplifying notation, hereinafter we will use $u_1$ instead of $\\tilde{u}_1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we are not just interested in finding $u(t_1)$ for a $t_1$ close enough to $t_0$, but we want to find $u(t)$ for any $t\\in[t_0,T]$. Let's see what happens if we apply the same process at $t_2=t_1 + \\Delta t$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\tilde{u}_2=u_1 + \\Delta t\\dot{u}_1 + \\frac{\\Delta t^2}{2}\\ddot{u}_1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this expression we need $u_1$, which is known, $\\dot{u}_1$, which is unknown, and $\\ddot{u}_1$, that is also unknown. From the equation of motion, we can get the value of $\\ddot{u}_1$ in terms of $u_1$ and $\\dot{u}_1$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\ddot{u}_1=f(u_1,\\dot{u}_1)=\\frac{1}{m}(F(t_1)-ku_1-c\\dot{u}_1)$$ (ddotu1)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we still have $\\dot{u}_1$ as an unknown in \\eqref{u2}. Let's try to approximate it using a TS again with $r=2$ terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\dot{u}_1=\\dot{u}_0+\\Delta t\\ddot{u}_0+\\frac{\\Delta t^2}{2}\\frac{d^3u_0}{dt^3}$$ (dotu1)\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem now with equation \\eqref{dotu1} is that we don't have the initial value of the third derivative in time $\\frac{d^3u_0}{dt^3}$. Alternatively, we can use an approximation using a TS with $r=1$, leading to \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\dot{u}_1=\\dot{u}_0+\\Delta t\\ddot{u}_0$$ (dotu1_)\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we can obtain an approximation of $u_2$ in terms of $u_1$, $\\dot{u}_1$ and $\\ddot{u}_1$ that are known. This process can be generalized to an arbitrary number of steps. Let's assume that we discretize the time in $N$ equally distributed time points, $[t_0,t_1,t_2,...,t_N]$, where $t_i=i\\Delta t$. Knowing the solution and its first time derivative at time $t_{i-1}$, we can find the solution at $t_i$ by\n",
